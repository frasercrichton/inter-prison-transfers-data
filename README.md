# Inter Prison Transfers in Aotearoa/New Zealand

## FOIA - Inter-Prison Transfers Across Time and Place

https://fyi.org.nz/request/16105-inter-prison-transfers-across-time-and-place#outgoing-27826

```
Tēnā koutou,

I'm interested in tracking non-identifying data on prisoner transfers within the prison system in Aotearoa.

If possible I'd like data for prisoners sentenced and on remand for the period 2011-2021 and specifically:

- the date of transfer
- the name of the prison that the prisoner was transferred from
- the name of the prison that the prisoner was transferred to

It would be really helpful if you could also include:

- the reason for their transfer
- where an individual has been transferred multiple times would it be possible to assign that person a non-identifying code so it's possible to track the prison facilities they have been incarcerated in?

Please provide this information in an accessible, searchable format. I would prefer to receive the requested figures in a machine-readable spreadsheet format, such as CSV or XLSX.

If any part of my request is unclear, please don't hesitate to contact me.

If any of the information that I have requested is unavailable or would be difficult to retrieve, but similar information might be readily available, I would be happy to discuss altering or refining my request.

If any part of my request is to be refused, under section 19(a)(ii) of the Official Information Act please provide the grounds in support of the reason for refusal.
Also, if the time limit for this request is extended under section 15A(1)(b) of the Official Information Act, please explain what consultations are necessary to make a decision on my request, why they are necessary, and why they could not be reasonably completed within the original time limit.

Ngā mihi,

Fraser Crichton
